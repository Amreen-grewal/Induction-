## Day 1 – 31st July 2025  

The campus of **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana**, echoed with energy and anticipation on the first day of the **Student Induction Program 2025**. The day unfolded in a manner both warm and inspiring, setting the tone for an enriching academic journey ahead.  

The morning began at **8:30 AM** in the serene premises of the *Gurdwara Sahib* within the GNDEC campus. The atmosphere was filled with the recitation of *Japji Sahib*, followed by the soulful *Shabad Kirtan* — *"Satguru hoye dyaal, kr krpa tere gun gawan, kr kirpa apni bhagti laye"*.  

**Observation:** The structure of the *Gurdwara Sahib* caught my attention — its shape closely resembles a ship, symbolically carrying us into a new voyage of learning.  

After tea, the formal induction program commenced in the auditorium. The hosts reminded us that this was our first day of college life — a milestone that would shape, challenge, guide, and empower us for the next four years. This year also holds special significance as **GNDEC celebrates its Platinum Jubilee**, marking 70 years of academic excellence.
