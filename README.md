## Day 1 – 31 July 2025  

The campus of **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana**, was alive with energy and anticipation on the first day of the **Student Induction Program 2025**. The day unfolded warmly and inspiringly, setting the tone for an enriching academic journey ahead.  

The morning began at **8:30 AM** in the serene premises of the *Gurdwara Sahib* within the GNDEC campus. The atmosphere was filled with the recitation of *Japji Sahib*, followed by the soulful *Shabad Kirtan* — *"Satguru hoye dyaal, kr krpa tere gun gawan, kr kirpa apni bhagti laye"*.  

> **Observation:** The structure of the *Gurdwara Sahib* closely resembles a ship, symbolically carrying us into a new voyage of learning.  

After tea, the formal induction program commenced in the auditorium. The hosts reminded us that this was our first day of college life — a milestone that would shape, challenge, guide, and empower us for the next four years. This year also holds special significance as **GNDEC celebrates its Platinum Jubilee**, marking 70 years of academic excellence.

- **Expert Lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh (Shiksha Ratan)** – Delivered an engaging session on the deep connection between mathematics, science, and life. He began with the *sakhi* from Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s childhood, where learning the number “1” became a spiritual realisation of *Ek Onkar*. He explained that the three components of the *Ek Onkar* symbol represent the Creator (Generator), Preserver (Operator), and Destroyer.  
  He then demonstrated how vibrations travel by showing their speed in a practical way, linking it to how attentive and responsive students should be in class. Using utensils, he produced different sounds by holding them from various points, illustrating how guidance (the “hold” of a Guru) shapes what we produce in life. Overall, he intertwined science and mathematics with elements of faith, making the lecture memorable and thought-provoking.
